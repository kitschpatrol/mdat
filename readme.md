## Prior Art

- [projectz](https://github.com/bevry/projectz)
  Goes way back. Watch the video.
- [mdast-zone](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-zone/tree/main)
  From universaljs creator.
- [markdown-magic](https://github.com/DavidWells/markdown-magic)
  Some how missed this when I was looking for a tool. I discovered it after planning to call mdat "magic mark".
- [mdast-comment-marker](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-comment-marker)
  Also from universaljs creator. Different argument style.
