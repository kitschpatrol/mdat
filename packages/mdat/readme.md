## Overview

This is a CLI tool and library implementing the Markdown Autophagic Template (mdat) system, which makes it easy to automate the replacement of placeholder comments in Markdown documents with dynamic content from a variety of sources. `mdat` also validates the structure and content of the Markdown document based on constraints specified in the expansion rules.

A trivial example...

Given placeholder comments in a Markdown file like this:

`some-file.md`

```md
<!-- title -->
```

Run your file through the tool:

```sh
mdat some-file.md
```

To turn it into:

`some-file.md`

```md
<!-- title -->

# mdat

<!-- /title -->
```

In this case, according to a set of rules defined in an external configuration file, `<!-- title -->` was replaced with date from `package.json`. The rule system behind these expansions is simple to define and readily extensible beyond the trivial example above.

The `mdat` CLI and library package sits between the lower-level \[`remark-mdat`] remark plugin, and the higher-level \[`mdat-readme`] package. `mdat` offers flexibility, but if you're just looking to expand some placeholders in your readme files then [`mdat-readme`](../mdat-readme) is the place to start.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

The `mdat` CLI tool requires Node 16+. The exported APIs for expanding Markdown text and documents are ESM-only and share the Node 16+ requirement. `mdat` is implemented in TypeScript and bundles a complete set of type definitions.

### Installation

Install locally to access the CLI commands in a single project or to import the provided APIs:

```sh
npm install remark-mdat
```

Or, install globally for access across your system:

```sh
npm install --global remark-mdat
```

## Usage

> \[!WARNING]\
> **The `mdat` CLI tool directly manipulates the contents of readme files, in close (and perhaps dangerous) proximity to your painstakingly crafted words.**
>
> Please make sure any text you care about is committed before running `mdat`, and never directly modify content inside of the comment expansion blocks.
>
> Set the `--meta` flag on the command to add a warning comment to the top of your file explaining the extra caution demanded around the volatile automated sections of your readme.md.

<!-- /cli-help -->

<!-- cli-help-note -->

_Meta note: The entire section above was generated automatically by the [`<!-- cli-help -->`](../mdat-readme/src/lib/rules/cli-help/index.ts) mdat expansion rule provided in `mdat-readme`. It dynamically parses the output from `mdat --help` into a markdown table, recursively calling `--help` on subcommands to build a Markdown representation of the help output._

<!-- /cli-help-note -->

#### Examples

##### Basic

Expand comments in a single Markdown file in-place:

```sh
mdat your-file.md
```

##### Multi-file

Expand comments in multiple Markdown files:

```sh
mdat *.md
```

##### Custom configuration

A number of option flags are exposed on the CLI. Any values set here will override both ambient configuration files and any configuration file referenced passed as options:

```sh
mdat  --prefix 'mm-
```

##### Custom configuration file

```sh
mdat  --config 'custom-config.ts"
```

##### Rule sets

```sh
mdat --rules 'rules.ts' 'more-rules.js' 'yet-more-rules.json'
```

### API

`mdat` exports a collection of functions to abstract the process of expanding placeholder comments into a single call. Type aliases are also provided.

Highlights include:

#### Expand String

```ts
function expandString(markdown: string, config?: ExpandConfig, rules?: ExpandRules): Promise<VFile>
```

Takes a string of Markdown and returns. Note that the returned object is a [VFile](https://github.com/vfile), which includes both the post-conversion Markdown content and additional metadata about the conversion.

To get the Markdown content, simply call `.toString()` on the returned VFile object.

#### Expand File

```ts
function expandFile(
  file: string,
  name?: string,
  output?: string,
  config?: ExpandConfig,
  rules?: ExpandRules,
): Promise<VFile>
```

Similar to `expandString()`, but takes a file path and handles setting an optional destination path and file name.

It's up to the caller to actually save the returned VFile object. The [to-vfile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/to-vfile) library can make this particularly painless:

```ts
import { expandFile } from 'mdat'
import { write } from 'to-vfile'

const file = await expandFiles(...)
await write(file)
```

#### Expand Files

```ts
function expandFiles(
  files: string[],
  name?: string,
  output?: string,
  config?: ExpandConfig,
  rules?: ExpandRules,
): Promise<VFile[]>
```

Like `expandFile()`, but accepts an array of inputs. If an output name is specified, the output files are suffixed with a number to prevent name collisions.

#### Load Config

```ts
function loadConfig<T extends Partial<Options>>(options?: {
  additionalConfig?: Array<T | string> | T | string | undefined
  additionalRules?: Array<Rules | string> | Rules | string | undefined
  configExtensionSchema?: z.ZodObject<any>
  searchFrom?: string
}): Promise<T>
```

This is provided for more advanced use cases. It assists in discovering and loading ambient configuration in your project (e.g. fields in your package.json, or dedicated `mdat` config files). It also dynamically loads, validates, and merges additional `mdat` configuration and rule files into a final `ExpandConfig` object ready to be passed into the [`remark-mdat`](../remark-mdat/readme.md) plugin or one of the API functions like `expandFile()`.

The function is generic to accommodate extensions to the configuration type in derivative projects. ([`mdat-readme`]() uses this approach.)

#### Examples

### Configuration

Expansion rules and certain aspects of global configuration are defined in configuration files which may be discovered automatically by `mdat`, or explicitly provided via command line options or library function arguments as shown above.

`mdat` implements configuration loading via [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig), which means a variety of configuration [locations](https://github.com/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig?tab=readme-ov-file#searchplaces) and file formats are supported. Configuration may be defined directly in your package.json, or in addition to stand-alone TypeScript files, JavaScript files, YAML, JSON, etc.

TypeScript or JavaScript with JSDoc annotations are recommended for the most flexibility and ease of implementing more advanced rules.

`mdat` also allows arbitrary JSON files to be loaded as rule sets, flattening them so any value may be accessed by using a dot-notation key path as a comment keyword.

#### Configuration file format

The `mdat` configuration file is a record object allowing you to customize aspects of the comment expansion process, and also optionally define expansion rules as well under the `rules` key:

```ts
type Config = {
  addMetaComment?: boolean
  closingPrefix?: string
  keywordPrefix?: string
  metaCommentIdentifier?: string
  rules?: Rules
}
```

A valid configuration file default-exports an object conforming to the above type.

The configuration file may be located in any location supported by [cosmicconfig](https://github.com/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig?tab=readme-ov-file#searchplaces). I use a `mdat.config.ts` file in the root of my projects.

#### Rule file format

Rules may also be defined in separate files that default-export a record of rules. The record keys become the keywords used to reference a rule from your comments in Markdown.

```ts
type Rules = Record<string, Rule>

type Rule =
  | string
  | ((options: JsonValue, tree: Root) => Promise<string> | string)
  | Rule[]
  | {
      content: string | Rule[] | ((options: JsonValue, tree: Root) => Promise<string> | string)
      applicationOrder?: number | undefined
      order?: number | undefined
      required?: boolean | undefined
    }
```

This is a bit complex, but it's indented to make defining simple rules simple, while still accommodating more demanding use cases.

Some notes on the type:

- Simple rules can be defined directly on the key, either as strings to replace the comment placeholder, or as sync or async functions returning a string.

- If you need more advanced rules, or wish to define conditions for the validation process, you break the top-level keyword key's value out into an object, where a `content` key on the object is responsible for returning the replacement string, and additional fields are available to define validation constraints.

- Note that `content` can itself take an array of Rule objects, which is useful for creating "compound" rules that combine several others into a single comment keyword.

Since it's a record, multiple rules may be combined in single rules file.

If multiple configuration and rule files are loaded, they are merged. CLI options take precedence over ambient configuration discovered by cosmicconfig, and where multiple configuration or rule files are provided, with the "last" rule of a particular key takes precedence.

## Creating custom rules

See the [Examples section](../remark-mdat/readme.md#examples) of the `remark-mdat` readme, or take a look at the implementation of the [rules bundled with `mdat-readme`](../mdat-readme/src/lib/rules/) for more complex examples.
